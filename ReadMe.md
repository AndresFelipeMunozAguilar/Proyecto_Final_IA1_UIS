# Multimodal Early Detection of Parkinson's Disease


## Overview

This repository contains the work done as part of the Artificial Intelligence I project for the Universidad Industrial de Santander. This project aims to develop a non-invasive multimodal strategy to enhance early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. By utilizing video and audio analysis techniques, we seek to identify distinctive patterns in motor symptoms such as facial rigidity and speech disorders.
